# Recipes Project
Welcome to my Recipes Project!

This is a basic HTML website consisting of recipes to my favorite foods. It will include elements that I've been practicing such as:
- Absolute and relative links
- Anchor elements
- Images with dimensions
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Target and relation attributes

The website will appear plain for now, but once I begin learning CSS I'll keep updating its visuals.
